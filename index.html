    <p>You have no doubt heard of the <a href="">Hare and the Tortoise?</a> Well, 
        <br>
        this is an African fable from Zaire which shows that Tortoises 
        <br>
        are good at winning all over the world. This story is about a 
        <br>
        trial of strenght. Who do you think is stronger, an Elephant or 
        <br>
        a Tortoise?</p>
